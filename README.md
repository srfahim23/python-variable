# Python-variable
Variables are containers that store information that can be manipulated and
referenced later by the programmer within the code.
In python, the programmer does not need to declare the variable type explicitly,
we just need to assign the value to the variable.

Example:

    name = "Fahim"   #type str
    age = 20         #type int
    passed = True    #type bool
