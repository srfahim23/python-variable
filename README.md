# Python-variable
Variables are containers that store information that can be manipulated and
referenced later by the programmer within the code.
In python, the programmer does not need to declare the variable type explicitly,
we just need to assign the value to the variable.

Example:

    name = "Fahim"   #type str
    age = 20         #type int
    passed = True    #type bool 

It is always advisable to keep variable names descriptive and to follow a set of 
conventions while creating variables:

Variable name can only contain alpha-numeric charecters and underscores 
(A-z, 0-9, and_)

Variable name must start with a letter or the underscore charecter.

Variable are case sensitive.

Variable name cannot start with a number.

Example:
    Color = "yellow"  #valid varaible name
    cOlor = "red"     #valid varaible name
    _color = "blue"   #valid varable name

    5color = "green"  #invalid varaible name
    $color = "orangee" #invalid variable name
